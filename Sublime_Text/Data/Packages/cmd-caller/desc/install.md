# Thanks for installing Cmd Caller

Cmd Caller can invoke predefined commands via a single hotkey, which will simplify your works greatly.

## How does it work
Settings of Cmd Caller contains the list of commands to be invoke, and when the hotkey is pressed, one of the commands will be invoked as you wish. 

There are predefined commands in the default settings, and you can customize with the user settings.

## Errors
If you find errors in the plugin, please run "Show Logs" command in the Command Palette, and [open a new issue](https://github.com/esphas/cmd-caller/issues/new) with the log file content.
